                            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect from May 25, 2018, empowers European
                            Union (EU) residents by placing them in control of their personal 
                            information and upholding strict protocols for organizations that collect and process this information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            GDPR defines Data Controllers as an entity that determines the purposes for which and the means by which 
                            personal data is processed. Data Controllers decide ‘why’; and ‘how’; the personal data should be processed.
                            The data processor processes personal data only on behalf of the Controller.
                            Cashify acts a Data controller or Data processor depending on the origin of the transaction.
